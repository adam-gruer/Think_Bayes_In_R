The Python class Pmf is a Python dictionary that maps a set of values to their corresponding probabilities.

example a six sided die with six values of equal probability.
 
    pmf = Pmf()
    for x in [1,2,3,4,5,6]:
        pmf[x] = 1
        
    pmf.Print()
 

This could be named list in R
```{r pmf as list}
pmf <-  as.list(rep(1,6))
names(pmf) <- 1:6
pmf
```
Or a tibble
```{r pmf as tibble}
library(tidyverse, quietly = TRUE)
pmf <- tibble(values = 1:6, prob = rep(1,6))
pmf
```
using the hash package
```{r }
library(hash, quietly = TRUE)
pmf <- hash(  as.character(1:6), rep(1,6))
pmf
pmf$`2`
```
Other alternatives could be a matrix or S4 or R6 classes
