This is an attempt to create an S3 class called **pmf**.

need a

- contructor, new_pmf()
- validator, validate_pmf()
- helper, pmf()

in S3 a class is a base type (e.g. vector, list) with the class attribute set.

My initial decision is that pmf will be a named double-precision vector .
```{r pmf constructor}
new_pmf <- function(x) {
# Represents a a probability mass function.
  stopifnot(is.double(x))
  structure(x, class = "pmf")
}
x <- new_pmf(c(1,2,3))
```
