# Think_Bayes_In_R
An attempt to translate the Python code in [Think Bayes](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes) by Allen B. Downey into R and possibly eventually a package.
I'm interested in exploring  different approaches to things such as data structures and programming paradigms.


Prompted by a [Dianne Cook tweet](https://twitter.com/visnut/status/909346673649840129)
